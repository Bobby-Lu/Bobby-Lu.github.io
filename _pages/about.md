I am currently a postdoc researcher with the group, [Stochastics](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/stochastics/), at [National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) (CWI, Amsterdam). I am supported by [European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics](https://www.ercim.eu). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of Twente, under the supervision of prof. dr. [Marie-Colette van Lieshout](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~colette/).
